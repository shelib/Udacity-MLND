New York City Rate Prediction Challenge

Predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York Given pickup and dropoff locations, the pickup timestamp, and the passenger count.


Project Overview

The project is taken from Kaggle competition:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxifare-prediction  
When we book a flight ticket, we know before taking off how much the airline ticket costs, so why should taxi ride be any different? Extending the “Know before you go” concept also to taxi transportation will benefit both end users and drivers. Upfront pricing makes riding simpler, while giving the end user control over how much they spend and providing the drivers ability to predict and optimize their return. These days with the competition in the transportation domain due to services like uber, getTaxi, grab, providing the end user and driving with a fare prediction is a must.
